# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
The Loan-providing companies find it hard to give loans to people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming defaulters.
	When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide on loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

•	If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business for the company.

•	If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

This case study aims to identify patterns indicating if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
     In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
